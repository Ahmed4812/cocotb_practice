# cocotb_practice

This repo is a simple intro practice for [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/). Goal is to practice on simple VHDL and/or SystemVerilog then apply for bigger projects.

## Installation
For installation just follow: https://hardwareteams.com/docs/fpga-asic/cocotb/1-installation/

In their installation gtkwave for mac may not work so I recommend to directly [build gtkwave](https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave). Gtkwave is to visualize your test-bench simulations.
